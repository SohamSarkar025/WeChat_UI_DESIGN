We Chat: The Social App Project üåê
Welcome to the "We Chat" repository! This project is the first step for our new start-up, a social app inspired by platforms like Facebook and built to be user-friendly and engaging.
What's Included?

This initial commit showcases the basic UI for our core experience, built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
 * Home Page: Features a clean navigation bar (notifications, messages, videos), shortcuts, and dedicated sections for events, ads, and live conversations.
 * Profile Page: The foundational layout for user profiles.
 * Interactive Settings: Click the profile icon to reveal the settings bar and test the functional light/dark theme switcher!
 * 
We're excited to share the start of our journey to build a new, engaging social platform. Thank you for checking it out!
